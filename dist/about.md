# About Piquiyo

Piquillo exists for one reason: to help post-seed B2B companies make and sustain growth predictable when it stops being founder-led.

Most startups don't struggle because they lack effort or ideas. They struggle because growth becomes fragile as the company scales. At some point, hustle breaks. Marketing has to become a system.

That's the moment we're built for.

## Why Piquiyo was created

Piquillo was created after seeing the same pattern repeat across different environments:
- Inside startups at different stages
- Working with venture funds and boards
- Operating within accelerators and scaleup programs

Founders close the first deals. Traction looks promising. Then pressure increases:
- Sales needs pipeline, not introductions
- Hiring more people doesn't fix inconsistency
- Boards ask for plans, not experiments

Many teams respond by adding tools, agencies, or more activity. Very few step back and build the system properly. Piquiyo was created to do exactly that.

## Experience that shapes how we work

The team behind Piquillo has worked:
- Inside B2B startups and scaleups
- With venture capital and growth equity funds
- Alongside accelerators and operator-led programs
- With founders, CMOs, and growth leaders under real board pressure

That means we've seen:
- How growth looks in pitch decks versus reality
- What investors actually ask behind closed doors
- Where marketing breaks as companies scale
- What survives board scrutiny and what doesn't

We don't guess. We recognise patterns.

## How we think about marketing

At this stage, marketing is not about visibility or creativity. It's about:
- Reducing uncertainty around growth
- Creating reliable demand
- Giving leadership and the board confidence in the numbers

We treat marketing as a control system, not a creative function. If it doesn't help sales plan, leadership forecast, or the board understand what's happening, it's not doing its job.

## How we work

We work closely with founders, CMOs, and Heads of Growth. Our team brings experience from:
- Early and growth-stage B2B startups
- VC and PE-backed environments
- Operator roles, not just advisory positions
- Collaboration with investment teams and boards

Our role is to:
- Clarify the GTM strategy
- Design the demand system
- Help run it until it works without heroics

We stay small by design. That means fewer clients, deeper involvement, and direct access to senior operators. No layers. No handoffs. No junior-only delivery.

## Who we work best with

Piquiyo is a strong fit for:
- Post-seed to Series B B2B startups and scaleups
- Teams with product-market fit
- Leaders accountable for pipeline and revenue
- Companies under real growth pressure this quarter

We're not built for:
- Early validation phases
- Pure brand or awareness work
- Teams looking for tactical help without accountability

## What success looks like

Success isn't noise or volume. It's when:
- Pipeline becomes visible and predictable
- Sales trusts the demand coming in
- Founders step out of day-to-day selling
- Growth can be explained simply to the board

That's the outcome we optimise for.

## Let's talk

If your company is at the point where growth needs to be repeatable, not heroic, we should talk.
