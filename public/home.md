# B2B growth, built to scale.

## What we do

Most post-seed companies don't need "more marketing". They need clarity, focus, and a system that works without heroics.

Piquiyo provides senior marketing leadership combined with hands-on execution. We help you define the right GTM strategy, build the demand engine, and make sure it performs quarter after quarter.

## Who we work with

We work with B2B companies that have product-market fit and real growth expectations.

**Typically:**
- Post-seed startups and scaleups
- 20–120 employees
- Founder-led, with growing operator teams
- Revenue targets tied to board oversight
- Marketing budget already allocated

**Our buyers are:**
- Founders and CEOs
- CMOs and Heads of Growth
- Operators accountable for pipeline and revenue impact

## Our approach

### Strategy first, always
We start by understanding your ICP, market motion, and growth constraints. No channels. No tactics. Just clear priorities.

### Build the system
We design a GTM model that connects positioning, demand generation, and sales enablement into one coherent engine.

### Execute with discipline
We don't hand over decks. We stay involved and help run the system with your team.

### Measure what matters
Pipeline, conversion, velocity, and repeatability. If it doesn't affect revenue, we don't optimise it.

## Why Piquiyo

Clients work with Piquillo because:
- They want senior thinking, not junior execution
- They want people who understand them and their worlds
- They need clarity, not more activity
- They want marketing to be data-led and explainable to the board
- They care about repeatability, not one-off wins

We're involved by design. That means fewer clients, deeper involvement, and direct access to senior operators.

## Let's talk

If you're scaling past early traction and need marketing to become predictable, let's talk.

## FAQ

### When should a B2B startup start investing seriously in marketing?
When sales can no longer be driven by the founder alone. This usually shows up when pipeline feels inconsistent, growth depends on last-minute pushes, and investors start asking how revenue will scale. It's not about ARR. It's about needing repeatable demand.

### What stage companies do you typically work with?
Mostly post-seed through Series B B2B companies. In practice, that means teams with product-market fit, real revenue targets, and pressure to make growth predictable. Earlier teams usually need learning. Later teams need systems.

### Do you work with early-stage startups?
Rarely. Pre-seed and seed teams often need to validate the product and close early customers manually. Marketing becomes critical later, when the question shifts from "can we sell this?" to "how do we keep selling this every month?"

### Are you an agency?
No. Piquillo works as a senior growth partner. We combine strategic leadership with hands-on execution, but we don't operate like a traditional agency with tickets, handoffs, or junior delivery.

### What's the difference between Piquillo and a fractional CMO?
Fractional CMOs often focus on direction and governance. We do that, but we also stay close to execution. We help design the system, run it with your team, and make sure it actually produces pipeline and learning.

### What results should we expect, and how fast?
We don't promise numbers before diagnosis. What we do promise is speed to signal. Within the first 30–60 days, you should have clear indicators of what's working, what's not, and where to scale or stop.

### Do you run paid ads, content, or outbound?
Sometimes. Only if the system requires it. We don't start with channels. We start with ICP, offer, funnel, and conversion logic. Execution follows strategy, not the other way around.
